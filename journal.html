				<h2>First</h2>
				<p>So it begins. This is the first in a line of thoughts and personal musings that I have internally digitally distributed for the world to know. I am of the opinion that the world is very much unabrest of what may emerge from my findings and personal ramblings. Yet, I do not lose faith that these findings will be of some use, to someone, somewhere.</p>

				<h2>Starter League</h2>
				<blockquote>Make a dent in the universe. ~ Steve Jobs</blockquote>
				<p>I feel such overwhleming gratitude and thanks for being able to presently be in this fine oranization. In a later post, I may delve into the bakcground that qualifies such a seemingly emotional outburst. The Starter League is an excellent opportunity for my band of classmates and I to enter a door that equips us with the tools whereby we may achieve our potential. It's going to be fun.</p>

				<h2>Why I'm buying Google</h2>
				<p>Now as a qualifier, I do not have $900 or whatever Google is trading at the time of this writing. Also, I am completely aware of the concept of investing on fundamentals, studying charts, and having an over-arching thesis to guide inverstment decisions. And the SEC has lowered their respecive blood pressures as I am admitting, full-disclosure, that I am far from offering advice</p>
				<p>Yet, in personal discussions with my imaginary board - we will get to that in a later post - and passionate keynotes given to my west bedroom wall I have struck a fascinating cord explained below.</p>
				<h3>Products</h3>
				<p>Media types and modern day philosphers (Tweeters) have scolded Google on their handling of Google Reader. Many question Google's over-arching thesis (or lack of thesis) and feel as though they have made the adolsecnt mistake of trying to bite off more world domination than they can chew. However, that which does not seem to grab the most attention is vastly intriguing</p>
				<p>Let's loook at Google's products:
					<p>Search<br>
					Mail<br>
					Maps<br>
					Android<br>
					YouTube<br>
					Analytics<br>
					Google+<br>
					Chrome<br>
				</p>
				<p>Excluding Google+, Google is capturing an alamrming percentage of market share if they are not already the undisputed, heavyweight of the world in that genre. And with "+", Google now has the ability to seamlessly connect search with social providing unpredecnted data enabling them to produce unprecendented value with minimal customer friction.</p>
				<p>But more importantly, it is amazing what Google is doing for the future. In 2007 it would be easy for knowldegbale indivuduals to question the idea of Google Earth and Google Maps. But here, is where on a personaly level I believe that Larry and Sergey (first name basis) are out of their minds brilliant. Throughr Earth and subsquqently maps, Google was able to essentially plot the earth with all its detail and fascination. So now, as the Google self-drving car has emerged, they have already built all the necessary infrastructure to lead that charge. And by the way, who has access to that all that data?</p>
				<h3>Open</h3>
				<p>There is something to be said for a truly great leader. Currently, I am wrapping up listening to the management classic <cite>Good to Great</cite>. One of the interesting things I have thought about is that Apple became great chiefly because of one extraordinary man, even though they are - for all intents and purposes - closed. However, Google's mantra has always been to be a open platform.</p>
				<p>From Android to OUYA to various different technology innovations, Google has strived to make the world and the interent more open. The embracing of others and having the conviction that "the cream will rise" coupled with the unwavering belief that "a rising tide lifts all ships" has allowed Google to position itself in such a way that is not self-serving, but making sure it is on the proper side of history.</p>
				<h3>Impact</h3>
				<p>Whatever personal feelings on systems such as Android, Google has done amazing good in democratizing access to top-line technology. If you looked at the cell phone market, if you did not buy Apple then you probably were using a rotary dial. But now, many would argue that there really is no sustantial evidicne between the two discounting design and small bugs. This has come a far way from people dropping to the floor in tears where the forsaken app-killer ending up committing a haneous act against the operating system.</p>
				<p>Additonally, I read an article recently about the thousands of Chromebooks being deployed in the nation's school systems. The idea that you can have a $250 device that is sleek, has free data, can create documents and projects, and is an excellent evader of viruses goes well beyond the call of Moore's Law. It must be Larry's, deliver immense value at next to nothing and wacth as you conqeur all.</p>
				<p>In the final analysis, it seems apparent that something is brewing in Palo Alto. These exitensial men, this alchemy of altruistic, opportunity seeking, visionary billionaires and laying the framework for a world that fails to look even remotely like the one we are presently viewing. Or maybe just simply is just through the lenses of the Google Glass.</p>
